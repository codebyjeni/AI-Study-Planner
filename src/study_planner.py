The agent follows a utility-based rational decision-making process.

For every subject, it considers:

1. Priority Weight
   - Important subjects receive higher priority.

2. Difficulty
   - Difficult subjects require more preparation.

3. Deadline Urgency
   - Subjects with closer deadlines become more urgent.

The utility function combines these factors:

Utility = (Priority × Difficulty × 10) / Remaining Days

The agent selects subjects with the highest utility scores first.
Therefore, the generated timetable attempts to maximize the
coverage of important and urgent subjects within the available
daily study hours.
